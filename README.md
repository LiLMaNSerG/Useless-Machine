# Useless-Machine
A mysterious contraption with only one purpose.

## About the Project
With spare parts that I had laying around, I was motivated to build my own version of the (not-so) Useless Machine. I've been wanting to learn how to use an Arduino for a while and thought this would be a great opportunity.

## Getting Started
### Supplies
- Ardunio Uno
- [Wooden Box](https://www.michaels.com/wooden-box-by-artminds/10357776.html)
- Standard Servo Motor : I am using a [Futaba S3003](https://www.amazon.com/Futaba-FUTM0031-S3003-Standard-Servo/dp/B0015H2V72/). You will want to make sure the servo has enough torque to fully depress the switch.
- [Servo Bracket](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PQ12TXS/) : Perfect for mounting to the underside of the door.
- 2 x 4-AA Battery Packs: I am using one for powering the Arduino and another for powering the servo. 
- 10K Ohm Resistor
- SPST (Single Pole, Single Throw) Switch
